Resharper Templates and code I've found useful to create unit tests.
Note, these are heavily tied to the UCDArch repository.
The FileTemplates contains two template to create files. One for repository tests, one for controller tests.
The LiveTemplates is a complete dump of all my user created templates.
The LiveTemplate_something are those templates I use more often. And only a single template per file.
